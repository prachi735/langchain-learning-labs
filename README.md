# 🧠 LangChain Learning Labs

Welcome to my LangChain learning repository — a hands-on journey through building with language models, tools, and agents.

This repo is structured around **experiments**, **mini-projects**, and **notes** that reflect key LangChain concepts.

## 🔍 Why This Repo?

I've started learning LangChain to build intelligent applications like chatbots, RAG pipelines, and LLM-based agents. This space documents my progress — with working code, notes, and observations.
